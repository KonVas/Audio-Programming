## Material for the Audio Programming class

This is a step by step tutorial for audio programming and real time sound
synthesis using the SuperCollider programming language. The examples are mainly
developed for the Audio Programming Class of MIAM department at Istanbul
Technical University (ITU). These are designed to provide general and practical examples of various synthesis and programming techniques which can be used in many contexts from laptop imrprovisation and composition of Electroacoustic Music. However, these tutorials are no aiming to rerplace the Help Browser of the SuperCollider application, thus many programming concepts are worthy to explore more using the application's help file in order to have a thorough explanation of each topic.
