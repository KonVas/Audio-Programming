## Material for the Audio Programming class

This is a step by step tutorial for audio programming and real time sound
synthesis using the SuperCollider programming language. The examples are mainly
developed for the Audio Programming Class of MIAM department at Istanbul
Technical University (ITU). These are designed to demonstrate the implementation
of various software development solutions for laptop imrprovisation and
composition of Electroacoustic Music. The tutorials and the examples are not aiming to rerplace the Help Browser of the SuperCollider application.
Thus many programming concepts are worthy to explore more using SC's help file in order to have a thorough explanation of each topic.
