# Audio Programming
This is a step by step tutorial for audio programming using the
SuperCollider programming language. The examples are developed from a
beginners point of view but familiarity with DSP and sound synthesis
concepts is imperative. [[Curricullum can be found at this link][https://github.com/KonVas/SuperMiam/blob/master/curriculum.org]]

## Goals
The course is designed to provide theoretical and practical examples of
various synthesis and programming paradigms which can be used in many
contexts from laptop improvisation and composition of fixed media to
Generative and Sound Art installations.
