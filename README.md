# Audio Programming
Audio programming in SuperCollider is a course that introduces students to the SuperCollider programming language and its applications in the creation and manipulation of digital audio. The course covers the fundamentals of digital signal processing (DSP), computer music theory, and the principles of sound synthesis.

Through hands-on exercises and projects, students will learn how to use SuperCollider to create, edit, and manipulate sound in real-time. The course will cover a range of topics, including:

Introduction to SuperCollider: overview of the programming language, its syntax, and its features
Digital Signal Processing (DSP): basics of sound and signal processing, Fourier transforms, filtering, and modulation
Sound Synthesis: additive, subtractive, granular, and physical modeling synthesis
Sampling: recording and playback of sound, manipulating samples, and real-time processing
Sequencing: building musical structures and patterns, and arranging sound in time
Effects: applying effects to sound, including reverb, delay, and distortion
MIDI and OSC: integrating SuperCollider with external controllers and devices
Students will also have the opportunity to create their own digital instruments, effects, and compositions, and to experiment with different techniques and approaches to sound design.

Throughout the course, students will develop a solid foundation in digital audio programming and gain practical experience in using SuperCollider to create innovative and expressive sound projects.
