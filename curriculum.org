# Audio Programming Class (AP)
The course aims to introduce students to programming of musical software
using the SuperCollider[fn:1] (open-source) programming language, a
state of the art platform for audio synthesis and algorithmic
composition. It will elaborate in programming concepts for real time
sound synthesis software used in various contexts including laptop
performances to interactive installations and electroacoustic works.
