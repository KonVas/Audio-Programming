# SynthDefs

A ``````SynthDef`````` provides the interface to create sound synthesis modules in SuperCollider. It also offers a set of interaction capabilities to alter the musical parameters of the sound synthesis on a higher level. To create it we type ```SynthDef```, it has to have a unique name, once is created we need to load it on the Server using the message '.add'. Now is a good time to boot the Server.

```js
(
SynthDef(\mySynth, {|out = 0, amp = 0.6| var sig; sig = SinOsc.ar([120.0, 121.0]); // a two output sine oscillator synth. sig = sig / 2; Out.ar(out, sig \* amp); }).add; )

Synth(\mySynth);
```

Our SynthDef is a (two output) sine oscillator synthesizer with fixed values (leftChannel:120.0, rightChannel:121.0), and it takes advantage of *multichannel expansion* in SC which is implemented using an array. This is one of the strenghts of SC as multiple ugens can be used to create complex sound engines. To hear the ```SynthDef``` we need to use another class names Synth, which is used to create an instance of the ```SynthDef``` which is loaded on the Server. You can also pass default values to a ```SynthDef``` like 'amp'. Sometimes we need to do more manipulation on the signal i.e., add a filter in the signal chain but is better to keep ```SynthDef```s simple and create other ones for extra manipulation.

## Output Signal & Busses
By convention out will be via the left channel of your audio, ```[0]``` that is unless you want to use some other busses to dtive your signal through it. 
Busses can be hard coded or assigned automatically, for example by default [0] is a buss that is allocated by SC. You may give define your own busses but this is uneccessary and cumbersome. Remember last week's discussion about the ```Server```. To understand how busses are working you may compare with analog mixer. Each input of the mixer can be assigned to a specific output and add some effects alike.

```js
~fx = Bus.audio(0, 1); // name of the bus is assigned as global variable inside your code.
```

## Envelopes and SynthDef

To apply ADSR properties to a ```SynthDef``` we use an Env specification. To be able to retrigger the envelope we use an EnvGen. Run this line below and see how the envelope of the synthesizer will look like.

```js
Env.new([0, 1, 0.9, 0], [0.1, 0.5, 1],[-5, 0, -5]).plot;
```

Envelope on our previous ```SynthDef```.

```js
(
SynthDef(\myEnvSynth, {|out = 0, amp = 0.3| 
var sig, env; 
env = Env.new([0, 1, 0.9, 0], [0.1, 0.5, 1],[-5, 0, -5]); 
sig = SinOsc.ar([120.0, 121.0]); 
sig = sig * EnvGen.kr(env, doneAction: 2); 
Out.ar(out, sig * amp); 
}).add; 
)

Synth(\myEnvSynth);
```

Assuming the previous ```SynthDef``` is loaded we can assign the Synth class to a variable like this below:
```js
x = Synth(\myEnvSynth); // x now is our Synth and can be used anywhere in our program as it is a global variable. 
x.set(\amp;, 0.1); // the set message requires the name of the parameter and a value.
```

## Discussion: anatomy of a ```SynthDef```

A ```SynthDef``` is the sound engine of our program or instrument we are building. It provides a set of interaction messages, such as .set .free and is a good idea to be started through another class named Synth and using the name of the ```SynthDef```. Make sure to load ```SynthDef```s using a method called ```.add;``` Each ```SynthDef``` can contain different oscillators and/or implement different synthesis techniques (e.g. granular).
