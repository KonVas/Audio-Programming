# What is SuperCollider

SuperCollider is a programming
language for audio synthesis; it provides a state of the art server to
synthesize sound and a fully integrated IDE, including the help browser.

SC is developed for musicians, sound artists and audio scientists
offering real time sound synthesis unit generators for algorithmic
composition.

Creating sound with SC can be very rewarding using its ready made unit
generators to build novel instruments and sound generators, in addition
there is a wealth of external plug-ins to expand the capabilities and
sound manipulation tools in SC.
