* Audio Programming Class (AP)
 
[[https://github.com/KonVas/SuperMiam/blob/master/SuperMiam/AP/images/SCScreenshot.png]]

The course aims to introduce students to programming of musical software using
the SuperCollider[fn:1] (open-source) programming language, a state of the art
platform for audio synthesis and algorithmic composition. It will elaborate in
programming concepts for real time sound synthesis software used in various
contexts including laptop performances to interactive installations and
electroacoustic works.
