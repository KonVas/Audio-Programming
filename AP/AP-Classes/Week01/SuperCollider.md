# Introduction

SuperCollider (SC) https://supercollider.github.io/ is a programming language for audio synthesis; it provides a state of the art server to create sound and a programming language to interact and evaluate code, as well as a fully functional IDE and help browser. SC is oriented for sound synthesis and algorithmic composition providing a series of ready made classes to manipulate and create real time sound on the computer.

Creating sound with SC can be very rewarding using its ready made unit generators to build novel instruments and sound generators, but what happens when one wants to improvise the structure of these instruments and change them on the fly.
