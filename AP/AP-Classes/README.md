# Creative coding with SuperCollider

This repository provides an overview on creating real time sound
synthesis for beginners with SuperCollider. Each chapter is offering a
series of tutorials and examples ready to run in the SC-IDE or any other
code editor.

Each chapter elaborates on a particular concept working in SC, for
example, how to evaluate code, how to separate code blocks, but also
more specific topics such as synthesizer prototyping, FFT analysis as
well as advanced concepts, such as live coding in SC.
