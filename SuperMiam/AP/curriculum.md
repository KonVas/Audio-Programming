  # Audio Programming Class (AP)
    The course aims to introduce students to programming of musical software using
    the [SuperCollider] [1] (open-source) programming language, a state of the art
    platform for audio synthesis and algorithmic composition. It will elaborate in
    programming concepts for real time sound synthesis software for various
    contexts including laptop performances to interactive installations. Some
    ready made implementations of sound synthesis techniques will be provided.
    Student output will be in the form of weekly coding assignments as well as
    final projects mainly demonstrating debugging and development skills.
